# Exercise to use a SVG image

It was first started as an exercise to create and use a SVG diagram with inskscape; then a simple one page site was built around it.
And then it was refined with small features here and there.

## Improvement on the SVG
- Learn drawing with inskcape
- Add shadow to boxes
- Use b-spline for arrows
- Manage crossing of arrows with transparency

## Built a single page website around that SVG
- Move to a static page with bootstrap and no jquery

### Add feature
- Add tooltip over each box/trick to show its definition
- Add links to some of the tricks to external website
- Add a combox-box to search for a trick by highlighting it
