# Exercise to use SVG

First create a SVG diagram with inskscape, and built a website around it.
And add feature after feature.

## Improve your SVG drawing with inskcape
- Add shadow to boxes
- Use b-spline for arrows
- Manage crossing of arrows with transparency

## Built a single page website around that SVG
- Deal with post-mortem IE8 (no inline SVG)

### Add feature
- Add tooltip over each box/trick to show its definition (Qtip jquery plugin)
- Add links to some of the tricks to external website
- Add a combox-box to search for a trick by highlighting it
